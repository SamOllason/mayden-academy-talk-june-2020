Slides from a talk I gave to the [Mayden Academy](https://mayden.academy/) cohort in June 2020.
 
At the talk I shared my experiences of developing mobile applications with React Native and Swift.
I compared the development experience across different areas and concluded that I overall prefer developing
with React Native.

I created the slides with a React-based tool called Spectacle. You can view the live presentation [HERE](https://samollason.github.io/bdf-oct-2019-presentation/).

This was based off of a talk at [Bath Digital Festival 2019](https://bathdigitalfestival.co.uk/speakers/-/sam-ollason.html) and at [BristolJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBgHuZKKmFI)
and both were based on [this](https://medium.com/@sam_ollason/react-native-vs-swift-ios-c144496f1519) article I wrote on Medium.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the slides locally run `npm i` and `npm start`
